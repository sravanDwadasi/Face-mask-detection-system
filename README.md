# Face Mask Detection

To protect oneself, it is now essential for all citizens to wear a face mask. This application can be beneficial to all shop owners, offices, banks, and other public places because anyone who is not wearing a mask should not be permitted to enter the area. As a result, we don't need any guards or people to keep an eye on people to solve this problem. We can incorporate a camera that takes continuous photographs of persons and detects whether or not they are wearing a face mask based on their faces.

Using opencv2 library, we created a Machine Learning model for detecting human face and for classifying whether the person wears mask or not. It captures images from a real-time camera, detects faces, and shows whether or not the individual in the image is wearing a mask. Implemented the model in various Machine learning algorithms like 
1. SVM,
2. KNN, and
3. Naive Bayes Classifier.
